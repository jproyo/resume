    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a passionate software developer with 15+ years of experience in Software Engineering and Development. During my profesional career I have been involved in many different types of solutions and companies from Enterprise traditional such as Financial, Telecommunication, Retail, Traveling to Startups companies lately.
      <br/>
      Some years ago I got tired from Java, as i supposed many of Java devs also did :D, and decided to start learning other languages searching a more efficient and formal (in a mathematical sense) approach to solve software problems. Obviously this kind of search led into Functional Programming languages and Haskell in particular. I have been researching, learning and doing things in FP for the last 5 years.
      <br/>
      Apart from doing and learning specific things in Software Development, i also love researching about Science, Math and CS theories in general.
      <br/>
      During my professional career I have also had the opportunity to lead teams. I consider myself a person with both technical and interpersonal skills which leads me to communicate better with my colleagues to create or maintain a great work atmosphere.
